***Multithreaded Higher Order Function Library for Java***

##Overview
This library lets you use following functions. Function chaining is also supported

 * map <br>
 * filter <br>
 * foldLeft <br>
 * foldRight <br>
 * reduce <br>
 * sort <br>
 * any <br>
 * every <br>
 * each <br>
 * split <br>
 * curry <br>
 * memoize <br>

Just do static import for FunctionUtil.* into your java file start using them, be careful while using the overloaded methods which accepts "noOfThreads" as last argument and tries to execute function concurrently.
