Multhreaded Higher Order Function Library for Java

This library lets you use following functions. Function chaining is also supported

map <br>
filter <br>
foldLeft <br>
foldRight <br>
reduce <br>
sort <br>
some <br>
every <br>
each <br>
split <br>
curry <br>
memoize <br>

If they appear friendly to you then just import FunctionUtil into your java file start using them, be careful while using the overloaded methods which accepts "noOfThreads" as last argument and tries to execute function concurrently.
