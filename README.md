***Multithreaded Higher Order Function Library for Java***

##Overview
This library lets you use following functions. Function chaining is also supported

 * map <br>
 * filter <br>
 * foldLeft <br>
 * foldRight <br>
 * reduce <br>
 * sort <br>
 * sortWith <br>
 * sortBy <br>
 * any <br>
 * every <br>
 * each <br>
 * eachWithIndex <br>
 * split <br>
 * curry <br>
 * chain <br>
 * memoize <br>

Just do static import for FunctionUtil.* into your java file start using them, be careful while using the overloaded methods which accepts "noOfThreads" as last argument and tries to execute function concurrently.

OR

If you are interested in chaining the functions use "chain" function.
